Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts whether a person has diabetes based on medical diagnostic measurements. The model is built using the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset and implemented in Jupyter Notebook with Python.
📊 Dataset
The dataset contains features such as:
•	Pregnancies
•	Glucose Level
•	Blood Pressure
•	Skin Thickness
•	Insulin
•	BMI
•	Diabetes Pedigree Function
•	Age
🚀 Steps in the Project
1.	Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, replacing zeros, scaling features.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding feature distribution & correlations.
3.	Model Training – Applied algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN.
4.	Model Evaluation – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
5.	Prediction System – User can input health parameters to check diabetes risk.
🛠️ Technologies Used
•	Python
•	Pandas, NumPy
•	Matplotlib, Seaborn
•	Scikit-learn
•	Jupyter Notebook
✅ Outcome
The machine learning model predicts diabetes with good accuracy, providing an efficient way to assist in early diagnosis and prevention.
