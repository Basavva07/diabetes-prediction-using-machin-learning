Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person has diabetes based on medical diagnostic measurements. The model is built using the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset and implemented in Jupyter Notebook with Python.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains features such as:

•	Pregnancies

•	Glucose Level

•	Blood Pressure

•	Skin Thickness

•	Insulin

•	BMI

•	Diabetes Pedigree Function

•	Age

 Steps in the Project:
1.	Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, replacing zeros, scaling features.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding feature distribution & correlations.
3.	Model Training – Applied algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN.
4.	Model Evaluation – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
5.	Prediction System – User can input health parameters to check diabetes risk.
   
 Technologies Used:

•	Python

•	Pandas, NumPy

•	Matplotlib, Seaborn

•	Scikit-learn

•	Jupyter Notebook

 Outcome:

The machine learning model predicts diabetes with good accuracy, providing an efficient way to assist in early diagnosis and prevention.
